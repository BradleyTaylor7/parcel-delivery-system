//Author - Bradley Taylor

//Declare variables as i will need variable to store data such as the customers name, prices and fees etc
//Will need parameter such as float and string

//Here i will want to show the prices on screen for the customer to see
//I will have to use console writeline and readkey to show the prices and extra fees

//Then i will need the customers details
//I will ask for the customers name and use readline to store what they tpye into the application
//I will ask for the customers email address
//I will ask for the customers mobile number

//Here i will gain the information such as the weight of the parcel which the customer will type in 

//I will make a message saying here is your quote and add the customer name to the end

//I will need to add IF statements which will be used to calculate the price for the customer depending on the weight of the parcel which they entered in
//I will use a IF ELSE statements

//IF the weight is equal to or less than 1kg then the cost for the customer will be the original price with no extra fees
//ELSE IF the weight is more than 1kg then the cost for the customer will be the original price plus an extra fee depending on how many kgs over the parcel is

//These statments will be used to work out all of the prices for each delivery option so the customer can see what is the most and least expensive
